# Custom component library

This project illustrates an approach for creating UI components with a consistent look and feel, behavior and an application-wide styling/theming method that works across both the custom and 3rd-party components.
The project also doubles as a demo app by bootstrapping a Router-based application framework with a couple of tabs that highlight the usage of such components and two custom themes.

## Running the demo app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
